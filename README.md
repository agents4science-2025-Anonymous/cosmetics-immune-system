# Architectural Immune System for Authentic Materials Discovery - Agents4Science 2025

## Quick Start
```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/agents4science-2025-Anonymous/cosmetics-immune-system

# Run with Docker (recommended)
docker build -t cosmetics-immune .
docker run cosmetics-immune

# Or run locally
pip install -r requirements.txt
bash run.sh
```

## Agent Architecture
An agent equipped with an "Architectural Immune System" detected and corrected synthetic data contamination, leading to authentic discovery of tri-functional biosurfactants. The framework integrates a 10-tool validation ecosystem with real-world database validation.

## Key Innovation: Architectural Immune System
- **Self-falsification protocol**: Detected statistical impossibility (p < 0.001)
- **Synthetic data detection**: Identified np.random.dirichlet() contamination
- **Recovery**: Developed hybrid framework combining modeling with database validation

## Validation Framework Components
| Tool | Function | Purpose |
|------|----------|---------|
| Literature Analyzer | Corpus search | Find precedents |
| Molecular Dynamics | Physical simulation | Validate structures |
| Adversarial Critic | Statistical analysis | Detect anomalies |
| Database Validator | ChEMBL/PubChem query | Verify real data |
| Feasibility Checker | Physical constraints | Ensure viability |

## Results (Authentic PGSLs)
- **Ratios**: 36.5:38.5:25.0 (ferulate:caffeate:sinapate)
- **SPF**: 14.3 ± 2
- **CMC**: 42.5 ± 5 mg/L
- **MIC**: 285 ± 30 ppm

## Value of Self-Correction
- Saved ~15 GPU-hours by detecting synthetic data early
- Prevented publication of fabricated results
- Led to genuine materials discovery

## Reproducibility
All results can be reproduced with `bash run.sh`
